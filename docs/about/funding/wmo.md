<!--
A small amount of funding, together with support, has been provided by WMO in order to help establish the the OpenCDMS Project.

This funding.... standards, reference implementation (demonstrating how to implement standards) and capacity development. Consistent with goals 1 & 2

Although goals 3 & 4 offer benefits to WMO members, these are not directly funded. 

Goal 4 is also in alignment with WMO private partnership
