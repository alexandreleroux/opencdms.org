## Recommendations on specific country-focused CDMS requirements

Members of the working group performed two rounds of consultations for African, Caribbean and Pacific regions. The initiative received a lot of engagement and feedback. Users requested support for current CDMSs and also highlighted the importance of data rescue and the need for native language communication in relation to CDMS-relevant training and capacity development.

The requirements arising from activity 2.4.1 will be considered as part of the OpenCDMS software development.
