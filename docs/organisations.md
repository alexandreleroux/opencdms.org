# OpenCDMS for organisations

The OpenCDMS Project is actively seeking strategic partnerships with additional interested organisations and stakeholders.        

Many NMHSs are considering updating or replacing their Climate Data Management System, or are already in the process of doing so. Contributing with the OpenCDMS project will help to:

1. Reduce duplication of effort
2. Help ensure solutions are fully compliant with existing and emerging standards
3. Ensure a higher ROI from investing in a common solution by directly benefiting from contributions made by other organisations

We are actively seeking contributions from business analysts, users and software developers in addition to a variety of other experts.

### Business Analysts

The OpenCDMS Project would welcome input from a senior business analyst to assist with the gathering and definition of requirements.
