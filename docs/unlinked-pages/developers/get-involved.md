The OpenCDMS Project continues to need assistance with software development.

Currently, the main languages used are Python and R.
Experience, or an interest in, SQLAlchemy, Flask or Pandas would be especially useful.

The project will also work on a web-based user interface and develop reusable web components. Experience, or an interest in, React, TypeScript, Progressive Web Applications or W3C Web Components would also be especially useful.

We would also welcome help with system adminstation including Linux, Docker and possibly Kubernetes in the future.

The majority of software developed for the project will be made available under the [agreed open-source license](/about/license). Developers will also need to sign a Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA) which authorises the project to use your contribution. More details are [available on request](/about/contact).
